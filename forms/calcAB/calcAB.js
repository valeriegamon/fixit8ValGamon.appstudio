/* 
ABScenario: You will be writing a program that uses a function and a loop. 
The function will take pairs of numbers from an array, add them, and give the sum back to the main program.

Create a function named Calculate that takes 2 parameters and returns the product of the two numbers.
In the main program, use a loop that calls the function as many times as needed.
Each time the loop will call the function and pass 2 numbers from the array.
Inside the loop, you will keep a running total of the sums of the pairs of numbers as they are returned by the function.
When the loop is done, output the final sum to the console.

let myNumbers = [123, 433, 54326, 2234, 1919, 1123, 1928, 3374, 23, 190, 33874]
console.log(myNumbers)
